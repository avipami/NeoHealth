## NHealth is all about moving to smart info

The apps main purpose is to keep track on how many calories you consume through moving and exercicing and then give you a example output of recomended recepies for you to cook and to be able to keep your shape or loose weight. 
This project is at an ongoing state and functionalities will be added with time. 

### App in its Current state and its Libraries:

* App made in Swift
* Firebase Connection installed through Cocoapods
* Healthkit data access
* App layout written in SwiftUI
* Connection to recepie DB for fetching weekly recepies at a young implementation

## Further plans on implementations

	---
	* Vibrational feedback when buttons are pressed for a better UI 
	experience. A Low contrast GUI can make it a challenge for the end user to grasp where is what and what it does.
    
    * Dark Mode

	* Fully working calculator for effective weightloss through data 
	collection and recepie recommendations. 

    * Possibility to make an account with data stored on a better 
    database solution like Atlas Mongo or the option to store 
    everything locally. 
    
    * Menu to input data from the user as weight, calories eaten and so on.

	* Print out weekly shopping list
	
	* Bonus badges on how active a person is and how well the diet is 
	going, these bonuses can also consist in letting the user
    cheat with something sweet och rich in calories.

## System Architecture

![Curr Archi](https://github.com/avipami/NeoHealth/blob/main/Images%20Readme/currArchi%402x.png)

The app is currently connected to a Firebase solution where it fetches user data as name, calories consumed by excercising and how many steps are taken in a day. 

For future implementation a query will be made on a backend online solution that calculates good recepies and gives  recommendations for the user to get broader cooking skills and also loose weight, and this is by keeping track on the amount of calories they put into their bodies. 

A connection to the IOS HealthKit Api this application can gather live data from all of the sensors a phone has and display the amount of calories the user has used during the day and then how many steps have been taken as to give relative data to compare to.  

### A future implementation to take this app and commercialize it would look like this on the architectural plane :
